## GitHub Tools

All participants have been added to the [icesat-2hackweek organization](https://github.com/icesat-2hackweek) page before arriving. GitHub [organizations](https://help.github.com/articles/about-organizations/) are shared accounts allowing people to collaborate across many projects at once. Once projects are formed participants will be organized into [teams](https://help.github.com/articles/organizing-members-into-teams/). Teams are convenient because we can set repository permissions to groups of people rather than individuals, and in our communcations the teams can be mentioned in issues.    

## Getting started with a Project

Each hackweek project should be initiated by adding a new repository to the [icesat-2hackweek organization](https://github.com/icesat-2hackweek).  The project name should follow the sequence ic2hw2019_short_snappy_title, for example, see this Geohackweek [ghw2018_snowmelt](https://github.com/geohackweek/ghw2018_snowmelt) project repository from 2018.  

Once you have created your project repository, populate the readme with the structure provided in the [Project Guidelines](https://icesat-2hackweek.github.io/wiki/project_guidelines.html). Finally, go to the [projects_2019](https://github.com/icesat-2hackweek/projects_2019) repository and edit the table in the README file to include a hyperlink to your project where you have the option of adding other details like Slack Channel link, data locations, and other details about project and data science leadership on the project.  

## Project guidelines

Each project requires a brief project summary in the readme.md of each GitHub project folder. Below is a template for the project summary. 

### Project Title

Brief title describing the proposed work.

### Collaborators on this project

List all participants on the project and identify project and data science leads.

### The problem

What problem are you going to explore? Provide a few sentences. If this is a technical exploration of software or data science methods, explain why this work is important in a broader context.

### Application Example

List one specific application of this work.

### Sample data

If you already have some data to explore, briefly describe it here (size, format, how to access).

### Specific Questions

List the specific tasks you want to accomplish or research questions you want to answer.

### Existing methods

How would you or others traditionally try to address this problem?

### Proposed methods/tools

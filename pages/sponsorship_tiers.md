As a hackweek sponsor for this event, your number one responsibility is also to adhere to the hackweek [code of conduct](https://geohackweek.github.io/wiki_ghw/code_of_conduct.html) designed by the Seattle data science community. Your visibility throughout the event provides you with a unique opportunity to demonstrate professional, respectful behaviors that other participants can emulate throughout the week. 

# What can sponsors expect to gain from this experience?

This is an opportunity to build new contacts in the community, recruit students and generate new project ideas.  Participants will also have the opportunity to learn about you and your activities.
